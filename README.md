Here is a sample README file for your Underwater Image Enhancement project:

Underwater Image Enhancement using Machine Learning
Overview
This project focuses on enhancing underwater images using machine learning and image processing techniques. The objective is to improve the visibility of underwater images by addressing common issues such as low contrast, color distortion, and poor lighting. The techniques employed include Histogram Equalization (HE), Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), and White Balance, with the goal of improving image clarity and color fidelity.

Project Description
Underwater images often suffer from color distortion, low contrast, and visibility issues due to the scattering and absorption of light in water. This project aims to address these problems by enhancing image quality using the following techniques:

Histogram Equalization (HE): Improves the overall contrast of the image by redistributing the intensity of the pixels.
Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE): Enhances local contrast, especially in regions with low visibility.
White Balance: Corrects the color temperature of the image to restore accurate colors, particularly the blue and green hues dominant in underwater photography.
Techniques Used
1. Histogram Equalization (HE)
Histogram equalization improves the contrast of an image by redistributing the intensity values of the pixels across the entire image, resulting in a clearer and more detailed image.

2. Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE)
CLAHE is a more localized version of histogram equalization. It enhances contrast in small regions, ensuring that the enhancements don't cause noise amplification in areas with uniform intensity.

3. White Balance
White balance correction adjusts the colors in an image to appear more natural, compensating for the blue or green tint that often dominates underwater scenes.

4. Machine Learning Models
Machine learning models are used to automatically analyze and enhance image quality, leveraging large datasets of underwater images to train the system for automatic correction and optimization.

Installation
To use this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/underwater-image-enhancement.git
cd underwater-image-enhancement
2. Install required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
The requirements.txt includes all the necessary Python libraries such as opencv-python, numpy, matplotlib, and any other dependencies.

Usage
1. Enhance a single image:
You can enhance an underwater image using the following Python script:

bash
Copy code
python enhance_image.py --input_path "path_to_your_image.jpg" --output_path "path_to_output_image.jpg"
2. Batch processing:
If you have multiple images to enhance, you can run the batch script:

bash
Copy code
python batch_enhance.py --input_dir "path_to_images_directory" --output_dir "path_to_output_directory"
Evaluation
To evaluate the performance of the image enhancement techniques, the following statistical analysis and metrics are used:

Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)
Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)
Color Fidelity Score
The output is compared with the original image to assess improvements in clarity, contrast, and color accuracy.
